     Quixote - Orchestration for Trusted Security Event Modeling

OVERVIEW:
=========

This source archive contains a userspace implementation of trust
orchestrators, Trusted Modeling Agents (TMA's) and support utilities
that enable use of the Linux Trusted Security Event Modeling (TSEM)
Linux Security Module (LSM).

The following documentation file is a copy of the documentation for
the TSEM LSM that is part of the LSM documentation for the Linux
kernel:

Documentation/tsem.rst

The noted document contains a complete review of the theory and
implementation of the Linux TSEM LSM and serves as a good starting
point for understanding the concepts surrounding security modeling.

The beginning of this document also contains a QuickStart summary for
the basic use of the Quixote trust orchestrators.

The following URL is the download site for the Quixote Trust
Orchestration system:

ftp://ftp.enjellic.com/pub/Quixote

Users who may want to experiment with trust orchestration, without
moving forward with a full compilation, will find packages that
contain pre-compiled binaries. These binares are statically compiled
and linked against the MUSL C library and should run on any x86_64
platform with a TSEM enabled kernel.

The FTP site also contains patches against long term stable kernels.

Trust Orchestrators:
====================

Trust orchestrators are utilities that run in a process in a
subordinate security modeling domain coupled with a Trusted Modeling
Agent (TMA).  The root of trust for a modeling domain is determined by
where the TMA is implemented.

The following trust orchestrators are currently implemented:

Utility			TMA Location
-------			------------
quixote			Kernel
quixote-us		Userspace process
quixote-sgx		SGX enclave
quixote-sgx-u		SGX enclave (unified binary)
quixote-xen		Xen hypervisor stub domain
quixote-mcu		Micro-controller
